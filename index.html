intro: 
  - excerpt: 'The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of natural language processing. Yet, how ‘good generalisation’ should be defined and how it should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any common standards to evaluate generalisation. As a consequence, newly proposed models are not usually systematically tested for their ability to generalise. The GenBench mission is to make generalisation testing the new status-quo in NLP. As a first step, we present a <i>generalisation taxonomy</i>, an elaborate <i>review of over 400 generalisation papers</i>, and we make <i>recommendations</i> for promising areas for the future. You can find all this information in our <a href="dummy link" target="_blank">taxonomy paper</a>. On this website, you can <a href="/taxonomy/">learn about the taxonomy</a>, you can <a href="/visualisations">dynamically explore our results</a>, and <a href="references">get citations from our analysi</a> or <a href="/contribute/">contribute papers</a> that we will add to our review.'
