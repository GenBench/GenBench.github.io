* Intro statement: on this page you can dynamically view our survey existing generalisation (with [link to explanations on the taxonomy page](/taxonomy) + survey)
* Some information about how you can contribute to the survey data, what the requirements are, and when the last paper was added (?), and how many papers are currently surveyed.
* The possibility to visualise the data in different ways, using click and play plotting possibilities

* Some indication for people that want to use plots generated on our website (we want them to!)
* [A link to a page with the full list of papers, including how they are characterised](/bibliography) (also there it might be nice if we have some options for listing them differently, e.g.: give me all papers that fall in this specific category in the taxonomy).
