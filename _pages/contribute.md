We welcome contributions of new papers to be included in our review.

To submit papers, you can use the annotation diagram below.
Bear in mind, however, that the diagram is a simplified version of the full taxonomy.
Please refer to the [taxonomy paper](paper) to get a better understanding of what should be annotated how.
It is possible for a paper to have multiple experiments with different axes values, in that case, you have to walk through the diagram multiple times.
We also compiled an [FAQ](FAQ) page with common annotation questions.
Once you have decided the axes values, you can submit your paper via [the following link](https://forms.gle/aXryWgcWmNgAabLQ6).
We will double check your annotation and add the paper to our review.
Please fill out also your name, so that we can reach out in we think a paper should be annotated differently.

Many thanks for your contribution!
