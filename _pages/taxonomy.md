The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of natural language processing, yet how 'good generalisation' should be defined and what it entails in practice is not well understood.
To be able to better talk about generalisation research in NLP, and identify what is needed to move towards a more sound and exhaustive approach to test generalisation, we present a (nominal) axes-based taxonomy along which research can be categorised.
Below the infographic, we describe the meaning of the different axes.
If you are interested in exploring the results of our taxonomy-based survey of over 600 generalisation research papers, check our [existing generalisation research page](/research)!
For a detailed description of the taxonomy and the survey, you can also have a look at [our paper]().

# The axes

## Motivation
Work on generalisation can be motivated in different ways.
In our taxonomy, we include four common motivations:
- the _practical_ motivation, which
- the _cognitive_ motivation
- the _cognitive_ motivation
- the _cognitive_ motivation

## Generalisation type
Add explanation.

## Shift type

## Locus of shift
Add explanation.

## Source of shift

We would love to hear what you think about the taxonomy and include more papers in our survey.
