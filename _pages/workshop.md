# Workshop description

The ability to generalise well is often mentioned as one of the primary desiderata for models of natural language processing (e.g. [Marcus, 1998](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631); [Schmidhuber, 1990](); [Wong and Wang, 2007](); [Lake et al., 2017](); [Yogatama et al., 2019](); [Linzen, 2020](); [Elangovan et al., 2021](); [Marcus, 2018]())
Generalisation is crucial to ensure that models behave robustly, reliably and fairly when making predictions about data that is different from the data that they were trained on and is also important when NLP models are considered from a cognitive perspective, as models of human language.
Yet, what good generalisation entails and how it should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any common standards to evaluate it ([Hupkes et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03050)).
As a result, it is difficult to understand what the current state of the field is when it comes to generalisation.
It is difficult to understand how results in this area relate to each other, what sorts of generalisation are being addressed and which are neglected, which forms of generalisation testing we should prioritise in which types of scenarios, and how we can adequately assess generalisation in the first place.
Missing answers to all of those questions are standing in the way of better model development: what we cannot measure, we cannot improve.
The GenBench workshop on (benchmarking) generalisation in NLP aims to serve as a cornerstone to catalyse research on generalisation in the NLP community.
The workshop has two concrete goals:
* Establish a shared platform for state-of-the-art generalisation testing in NLP, with a leaderboard for a selection of tests that are created and selected not by one group, but by a larger community.
* Bring together different expert communities to discuss challenging questions relating to generalisation in NLP.

# Programme 
Our intended workshop programme consists of different elements:
- invited presentations
- spotlight presentation of type 1 submissions
- oral presentations of a selection of type 2 submissions 
- poster presentations of all submissions 
- a panel on generalisation, bringing together experts from different communities.

In the panel, we will discuss topics such as how to best involve domain experts in the design of generalisation tests, the future of generalisation testing and when generalisation testing is important and when it is not.
Furthermore, we will add topics drawn from the workshop submissions, as well as questions solicited through an online poll prior to the workshop.

# Submission types

To reach out workshop goals, we welcome two different types of submissions.

## Submission type 1: Collaborative Benchmarking Task
To achieve the first goal of our workshop, we organise a collaborative benchmarking task, in similar spirits to the [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) challenge, but focusing specifically on generalisation. 
We will invite researchers to submit challenging and diverse generalisation tests, within a relatively wide yet well-defined scope.
Submitters of splits will be asked to characterise their splits using the generalisation taxonomy presented by [Hupkes et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03050), and we specifically encourage submissions focussing on generalisation to underrepresented languages, with a fairness motivation, or any of the other challenges in generalisation research discussed by [Hupkes et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03050).
Generalisation test submissions need to be motivated and described in a paper submission, accompanied with results for selected models and an analysis of the results.
We also welcome submissions of existing generalisation datasets, which can be submitted through extended abstracts.
Accepted generalisation test submissions will be included in the proceedings of the workshop, and we will feature a top-selection, which will be included also in the GenBench 1.0 leaderboard, on the GenBench platform.
Following Big-Bench, after the workshop is finished, we aim to do a larger-scale testing with the top tests with a range of different models ([Srivastava et al., 2022]()).

## Submission type 2: generalisation and opinion papers 
Towards our second goal, we invite paper submissions on a specific set of topics related to generalisation in NLP.
More specifically, we welcome opinion papers (similar to, for instance [Linzen, 2020](); [Baroni, 2021](); [Marcus, 2018]()), meta- analyses that bring together different existing studies on generalisation (e.g. [Liu et al., 2022](); [Chaabouni et al., 2021]()), and papers that present state-of-the-art analyses of generalisation in modern NLP models (e.g. [McCoy et al., 2019](); [Lazaridou et al., 2021]()). 
We specifically encourage papers that attack one of the challenges presented in [Hupkes et al. (2022)]().

# Invited speakers

While we have to still confirm our final line-up, and availability will depend on the workshop venue, we have a confirmed interest of several exciting invited speakers and panelists.
